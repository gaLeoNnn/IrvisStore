# IrvisStore

The project I worked on as a freelancer for my clients in the glazing industry includes not only a well-designed webpage, but also a set of functional features such as sliders, tabs, modal windows, and pop-ups that significantly enhance the user experience on the site.
Special attention was given to the functional features that my clients in the glazing industry can use to showcase their products and services, as well as to organize information on the page.
My clients were satisfied with the outcome of the project because the project successfully helped my clients increase the effectiveness of their online presence and improve the user experience on their site
